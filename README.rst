Astrometry Uncertanties
#######################

Originally intended to be smtn-011, but renamed as it only reached notebook stage and didn't have the appropriate basic template for SMTN's (no github integration, not registered in lsst.io). 
Still useful information on how to approximate the final astrometric uncertainties and assumptions in MAF notebooks.
